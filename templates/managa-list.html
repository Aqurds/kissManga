										<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The story starts with the death of Hikaru Mikado. That guy was a natural charmer, a &ldquo;harem king&rdquo;, but had no real male friends. After he died, he became a ghost, a soul, but Koremitsu Akagi can see him. Koremitsu though, isn&rsquo;t really like Hikaru. His red hair and his evil-looking eyes make him look as a delinquent, even though he is very kind inside. Hikaru asks him a favour: he wants to fulfill a promise, which he couldn't fulfill anymore. The promise was to give his girlfriend and fianc&eacute;e, Aoi Saotome, 7 gifts for her seventeenth birthday. Koremitsu accepts, and has to work hard to help fulfill Hikaru&rsquo;s promise with Aoi.</span></p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">The "mysterious school comedy" centers on the unusual members of a high school literary club. Tōko Amano, a high school senior who calls herself the "literary girl" as the club president, is actually a supernatural creature (yōkai) that devours stories &mdash; she tears pages from books to munch on them. Her club subordinate is Konoha Inoue, a second-year high school boy who writes stories every day for Amano to eat. He once wrote an award-winning novel, but he wrote it under the penname Miu Inoue so readers thought the author was a mysterious 14-year-old bishōjo novelist. The stress from the novel's fame and its movie and television drama plans turned Inoue into an introverted recluse.</p>

										<p>G.U.+ follows the player Haseo, a powerful PKKer known as "The Terror of Death". Haseo is obsessed with an infamous PKer known only as "Tri-Edge" who attacked a close friend of his sometime in the past. The manga details Haseo's search for Tri-Edge, and his eventual inclusion in a mysterious group known as "G.U."&nbsp;<br />Back story of the ps2 game (same title)<br />In 2015 a fire at the main CC Corp. building resulted in the loss of a lot of data, and The World was forced to shut down. By splicing in data from what would have been another game, CC Corp was able to rebuild the game system. The next year, "The World R:2" was released, but many old players objected because they were unable to bring over their old characters. However, many new users were drawn in by the new style, and over 12 million copies were sold. Though not a match for the previous version's 20 million users, it became the top-selling netgame on the market." As a result of the new world, four major clans (Kestrel, Lunar Tree, Canard, and Raven) came to power. The clans actions shape 'The World', and most players end up taking one side or another during conflicts.</p>

However, in the perfect shoujo manga twist, one day she gets dragged to an alternate world where the people have summoned a Holy Maiden to save them&hellip;!<br /><br />Except so did her classmate, Haruka Toudou, who fits the exact model of a Shoujo Protagonist.

Although they had ruled the land for so many years, the truth is the politics is being centered on the elders from each region of the kingdom.<br />This seemingly peaceful kingdom was then disturbed by the mysterious death of the next successor to the throne; the death started to involve all of those who have the rights to succeed the throne to become the next king.<br /><br />Belca Noctircus is the son of a commoner and the King Noctircus. He is the third prince in the royal Noctircus family and is third in line for the throne. Soon after coming back from abroad, his brother, the crown prince Hector Noctircus, revealed his amibition to create peace with the Amonel (a race considered to be monsters); but mysteriously, he dies from a chronic disease. Belca and his second older brother, Orcelito, discovered the conspiracy behind Hector's death, and Belca was nearly killed because of that. However, he was saved by a wandering bard/scholar named Eco, who agreed to help Belca out, but is Eco really who he seems to be? Meanwhile Orcelito is captured by Lagen, whose son, a young nobleman, locks him up and manipulates Orcelito to do things by Lagen's bidding and wishes...&nbsp;</p>

										<p>At first glance Moolchi is just another shy, unassuming boy whose greatest talents are running away from bullies and binging on vitamin supplements. Then one day, Moolchi's absentee father sends him a most unusual gift--a stunningly-proportioned automaton. She calls herself "Six" and mumbles about having a "prime directive." This strange and exquisite creature quickly turns the boy's life upside-down, violently disposing of high school hooligans and anybody else who gets in his or her way. The word "oblivious" barely does him justice as Moolchi remains blissfully unaware of his father's dangerous double-life, or the cute hall monitor who harbors a crush on him, or the intentions of this mysterious femme fatale who insists on bathing with him. Meanwhile, ominous storm clouds gather on the horizon, and one lingering question looms above the others "who is this so-called "Zero" that everybody is looking for?</p>

											<span class="info">Summary:</span>&nbsp;
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Mei and Takeru are twins who have a very close, if slightly flirty, relationship, and are quite popular within the school. Their relationship is both a source of amusement and dismay to both the male and female school population, especially with Mei, whose massive brother complex keeps her oblivious to serious confessions from other males. Their relationship becomes even more complicated, however, when the two of them learn that they are not related by blood.</p>
